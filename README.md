# What is this?

This is a project that automatically collects artifacts to ease in air-gapped transfer from the internet.

It runs actions on Push or on Mondays at 00:00 and creates a release.

In this case, it collects node_modules and .yarn/cache needed.

Adding a comment because I don't know how else to rerun a job in Github
